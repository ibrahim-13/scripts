This simple batch file will keep all of your file indexed in a single file and then you can search within the
indexed file. This will take very short time to search for some specific file in the whole hard drive.

NOTE: YOU can use ANY PART of this batch file in your own program. All I want is just THANKS by including my
      name in your project.
